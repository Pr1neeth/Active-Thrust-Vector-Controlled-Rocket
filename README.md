## 📦 What’s Inside
- **Arduino Nano Flight Computer** with IMU + Barometric Sensor  
- **Gimbal-based TVC System** (±15° pitch/yaw) driven by SG90 servos  
- **KNSU Rocket Motor** (65% KNO3, 35% sugar)  
- **Parachute Recovery System** with electronic ejection charge  
- **Simulation** using MATLAB/Simulink for PID tuning  
- **CAD + PCB** designs for airframe and avionics
